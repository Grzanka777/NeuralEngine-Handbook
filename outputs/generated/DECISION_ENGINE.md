# Decision Learning Architecture

## Status and purpose

NeuralEngine source commit `1964356` implements the Decision, DecisionAcceptance, and
DecisionAction foundations plus the canonical minimal `DecisionLifecycleService` projection. They
record an immutable proposed choice, explicit authorization, and work performed under that
authorization. Each foundation persists immutable records, exposes application use cases, is
wired through the container, and provides a thin CLI.

The wider Decision Learning lifecycle remains accepted future architecture. Decision tracking
complements the existing Observation-to-Playbook chain; it does not replace it.

## Implemented foundation

The implemented foundations are exactly:

```text
Decision
EvidenceReference
DecisionAcceptance
DecisionAction
DecisionRepository
DecisionAcceptanceRepository
DecisionActionRepository
JsonDecisionRepository
JsonDecisionAcceptanceRepository
JsonDecisionActionRepository
DecisionService
DecisionAcceptanceService
DecisionActionService
DecisionLifecycleService
container wiring
neural decision add/list/show
neural decision accept
neural decision acceptance-history
neural decision action add
neural decision action-history
neural decision action-show
neural decision state
```

Creating a Decision records a proposal. Creating a DecisionAcceptance explicitly authorizes that
proposal for possible future work. Creating a DecisionAction records work performed under that
acceptance. None of these operations claims completion, success, failure, outcome, review, or
learning. `DecisionOutcome` and `DecisionReview` are future-only records.

## Decision model

`Decision` is an immutable domain model with these implemented fields:

```text
id
created_at
project_key
title
objective
context_summary
alternatives
proposed_option
rationale
observation_ids
evidence_references
proposed_by
supersedes_decision_id
idempotency_key
tags
```

Its implemented invariants are:

1. Required text is trimmed and non-blank.
2. At least two meaningful alternatives are required.
3. Alternatives reject case-insensitive duplicates.
4. `proposed_option` exactly matches one stored alternative.
5. Observation IDs are unique.
6. An optional superseded Decision must not equal the new Decision.
7. Tags are trimmed; case-insensitive duplicates are removed while first-seen order is preserved.
8. `created_at` is timezone-aware and normalized to UTC.
9. The model is immutable.
10. No mutable lifecycle status exists.

A material correction creates another Decision linked through `supersedes_decision_id`; it does
not rewrite the earlier record.

## EvidenceReference

`EvidenceReference` is an implemented immutable value embedded in a Decision,
DecisionAcceptance, or DecisionAction:

```text
kind
locator
repository_or_project
content_hash
captured_at
source
summary
```

`kind` and `locator` are required, trimmed, non-blank, and bounded. Optional text is trimmed,
bounded, and cannot be blank when supplied. `captured_at` is timezone-aware and normalized to UTC.
The complete value is serialized inside Decision JSON.

There is no Evidence repository, service, or CLI. A locator is retained as provenance only: the
Decision CLI does not open it, verify it, or ingest its content.

## DecisionAcceptance foundation

`DecisionAcceptance` is an immutable domain model with these implemented fields:

```text
id
accepted_at
decision_id
accepted_by
reason
evidence_references
idempotency_key
tags
```

Its implemented invariants are:

1. `decision_id` is a valid UUID.
2. `accepted_by` is trimmed and non-blank.
3. `reason` is trimmed and non-blank.
4. `idempotency_key` is trimmed and non-blank.
5. `accepted_at` is timezone-aware and normalized to UTC.
6. Tags are trimmed, reject blanks, and remove case-insensitive duplicates while preserving
   first-seen order.
7. Evidence references reuse the existing immutable `EvidenceReference`.
8. The model is immutable.
9. No mutable lifecycle status exists.
10. Acceptance does not embed or mutate the Decision payload.

The semantic boundary is exact:

```text
Decision
= proposed choice

DecisionAcceptance
= explicit authorization for possible future execution
```

Acceptance does not mean execution occurred, a DecisionAction exists, a DecisionOutcome exists, a
DecisionReview exists, or learning was created.

## DecisionAction foundation

`DecisionAction` is an immutable domain model with these exact implemented fields:

```text
id
recorded_at
decision_id
acceptance_id
action_type
summary
performed_by
started_at
completed_at
evidence_references
playbook_run_id
idempotency_key
tags
```

Its implemented invariants are:

1. Decision and acceptance IDs are valid UUIDs.
2. `action_type`, `summary`, `performed_by`, and `idempotency_key` are trimmed and non-blank.
3. `action_type` is bounded to 64 characters.
4. `recorded_at`, `started_at`, and optional `completed_at` are timezone-aware and normalized to
   UTC.
5. `completed_at` cannot precede `started_at`.
6. Tags are normalized like Decision tags.
7. Evidence reuses immutable embedded `EvidenceReference`.
8. Optional `playbook_run_id` is a UUID.
9. The model is immutable.
10. No mutable status field exists.
11. Decision and DecisionAcceptance payloads are not embedded or mutated.

The semantic boundary is exact:

```text
DecisionAction
= work was performed under an explicitly accepted Decision
```

It does not mean the work succeeded, validation passed, an intended result occurred,
DecisionOutcome exists, DecisionReview exists, or learning was created. `completed_at` means only
that the described work interval ended. It does not produce a `completed`, `executed`, or
`succeeded` lifecycle state.

## Persistence

The persistence-focused `DecisionRepository` port implements only:

```text
save()
load_all()
get_by_id()
```

No relation, project, or idempotency query was added. `JsonDecisionRepository` stores one JSON
file per Decision under `NeuralPaths.DECISIONS`. UUIDs, UTC-aware timestamps, embedded evidence,
and optional values round-trip through the domain model. `load_all()` sorts file names for
deterministic order. Malformed stored data surfaces domain validation errors; the adapter does not
silently repair it. No migration, evidence ingestion, file ingestion, or git ingestion behavior
exists.

The persistence-focused `DecisionAcceptanceRepository` likewise implements only:

```text
save()
load_all()
get_by_id()
```

It has no relation, project, or idempotency query methods. Relation and eligibility filtering
belong to `DecisionAcceptanceService`. `JsonDecisionAcceptanceRepository` stores one JSON file per
acceptance under `NeuralPaths.DECISION_ACCEPTANCES`, and Brain initialization creates that
directory. `load_all()` sorts file names for deterministic order. UUIDs, UTC-aware timestamps,
embedded evidence, and normalized tags round-trip through domain validation. Malformed stored data
surfaces validation errors. No migration or ingestion behavior exists.

The persistence-focused `DecisionActionRepository` implements only:

```text
save()
load_all()
get_by_id()
```

It has no relation, idempotency, or lifecycle query methods. Filtering and relation validation
remain in application services. `JsonDecisionActionRepository` stores one JSON file per action
under `NeuralPaths.DECISION_ACTIONS`, and Brain initialization creates that directory.
`load_all()` sorts file names for deterministic order. The complete domain record round-trips
through validation, and malformed stored data fails visibly. The adapter performs no migration,
ingestion, or command execution.

## Application service

`DecisionService` implements:

```text
add()
list_decisions()
show()
```

`add()` constructs an immutable Decision candidate first, validates every referenced Observation,
then validates an optional superseded Decision. A superseded Decision must exist and have the same
`project_key`. Only after these checks does the service perform idempotency detection and, when
needed, persist the candidate. It creates no other record, performs no lifecycle transition, and
does not trigger learning.

The implemented idempotency scope is:

```text
(project_key, "decision", idempotency_key)
```

The `"decision"` record type is implicit because the operation is owned by `DecisionService`.
Detection uses `DecisionRepository.load_all()` followed by application-layer filtering; there is
no repository idempotency query.

```text
same key + equivalent semantic payload
→ return existing Decision

same key + different semantic payload
→ visible conflict, no write
```

Semantic equivalence excludes generated identity and time values:

```text
Decision.id
Decision.created_at
EvidenceReference.captured_at
```

`list_decisions()` preserves repository order. Its optional project filter is trimmed and applied
in the application layer; a blank filter fails visibly. `show()` loads by UUID and raises the
existing explicit not-found error when no Decision exists.

### DecisionAcceptanceService

`DecisionAcceptanceService` implements:

```text
accept()
list_for_decision()
show()
```

`accept()` validates that the referenced Decision exists, constructs an immutable candidate, loads
all acceptance records, handles an equivalent idempotent replay, rejects conflicting key reuse,
rejects a second distinct acceptance, and persists only after validation. It does not mutate the
Decision and creates no action, outcome, review, or learning record.

The initial monotonic eligibility rule is:

```text
Decision exists
and no DecisionAcceptance exists
→ eligible for first acceptance
```

Only one acceptance per Decision is allowed. A superseding Decision does not invalidate an
existing acceptance. There is no rejection, withdrawal, reversal, reopening, cancellation, or
replacement behavior.

The implemented idempotency scope is:

```text
(decision_id, "decision_acceptance", idempotency_key)
```

```text
same scoped key + equivalent semantic payload
→ return existing DecisionAcceptance

same scoped key + different semantic payload
→ visible idempotency conflict, no write

different key + Decision already accepted
→ visible already-accepted conflict, no write
```

Semantic equivalence excludes:

```text
DecisionAcceptance.id
DecisionAcceptance.accepted_at
EvidenceReference.captured_at
```

`list_for_decision()` validates Decision existence, loads all acceptance records, filters in the
application layer, and preserves repository order without adding a repository query. `show()`
raises an explicit acceptance not-found error.

### DecisionActionService

`DecisionActionService` implements:

```text
add()
list_for_decision()
show()
```

`add()` validates Decision existence, acceptance existence, and that the acceptance belongs to the
same Decision. It validates an optional PlaybookRun exists, constructs an immutable candidate,
performs idempotency detection, returns an equivalent replay, rejects conflicting key reuse,
allows multiple distinct actions, and persists only after every validation. It mutates neither
Decision nor DecisionAcceptance and creates no Outcome, Review, Experience, Knowledge, Playbook,
or EvolutionProposal.

The current PlaybookRun limitation is explicit:

```text
PlaybookRun and Playbook currently expose no project_key,
so only existence can be validated without a separately reviewed schema change.
```

Action idempotency is scoped by:

```text
(decision_id, "decision_action", idempotency_key)
```

```text
same scoped key + equivalent semantic payload
→ return existing DecisionAction

same scoped key + different semantic payload
→ visible conflict, no write

different key
→ another action may be recorded
```

Semantic equivalence excludes:

```text
DecisionAction.id
DecisionAction.recorded_at
EvidenceReference.captured_at
```

`list_for_decision()` validates the Decision, filters `load_all()` in the application layer, and
preserves repository order. `show()` raises an explicit action-not-found error.

### Canonical DecisionLifecycleService

`DecisionLifecycleService` is the only canonical owner of the current lifecycle projection. It
depends on:

```text
DecisionRepository
DecisionAcceptanceRepository
DecisionActionRepository
```

It derives exactly:

```text
Decision exists, no acceptance
→ proposed

Decision exists, one valid acceptance, no action
→ accepted

Decision exists, one valid acceptance, at least one valid action
→ in_progress
```

No mutable status is written and no generic event stream exists. Repository order does not define
state; valid semantic relations do. Multiple persisted acceptances fail visibly, as does an action
linked to a wrong or missing acceptance. Multiple valid actions still derive `in_progress`.

These states are explicitly unavailable:

```text
executed
completed
succeeded
failed
reviewed
```

## Container

The composition root constructs and connects:

```text
JsonDecisionRepository
JsonObservationRepository
DecisionService
JsonDecisionAcceptanceRepository
DecisionAcceptanceService
JsonDecisionActionRepository
JsonPlaybookRunRepository
DecisionActionService
DecisionLifecycleService
```

`DecisionAcceptanceService` receives `JsonDecisionAcceptanceRepository` and
`JsonDecisionRepository`. The CLI resolves services from the container. It does not construct
repositories or own validation, relation checks, persistence, eligibility, or idempotency policy.

`DecisionActionService` receives `JsonDecisionActionRepository`, `JsonDecisionRepository`,
`JsonDecisionAcceptanceRepository`, and `JsonPlaybookRunRepository`. `DecisionLifecycleService`
receives the Decision, acceptance, and action repositories. CLI handlers resolve both services
from the container and construct no repositories.

## Implemented CLI

These commands exist at commit `1964356`:

```text
neural decision add
neural decision list
neural decision show DECISION_UUID
neural decision accept DECISION_UUID
neural decision acceptance-history DECISION_UUID
neural decision action add DECISION_UUID
neural decision action-history DECISION_UUID
neural decision action-show ACTION_UUID
neural decision state DECISION_UUID
```

`neural decision add` requires these scalar options:

```text
--project-key
--title
--objective
--context-summary
--proposed-option
--rationale
--proposed-by
--idempotency-key
```

It accepts these repeatable options:

```text
--alternative
--observation-id
--evidence
--tag
```

The optional supersession argument is:

```text
--supersedes-decision-id
```

Evidence is supplied as a bounded JSON value, for example:

```bash
neural decision add \
  --project-key NeuralEngine \
  --title "Canonical lifecycle ownership" \
  --objective "Choose one active-revision owner" \
  --context-summary "Two services could derive the same state" \
  --alternative "Activation service owns derivation" \
  --alternative "Application service replays records" \
  --proposed-option "Activation service owns derivation" \
  --rationale "One owner prevents semantic drift" \
  --proposed-by architecture-review \
  --idempotency-key decision-active-revision-owner \
  --evidence '{"kind":"agent_review","locator":".agent-work/reviews/review.md"}'
```

The CLI parses and validates this JSON value as `EvidenceReference`. It does not read the locator
or ingest any referenced file content.

`neural decision list --project PROJECT_KEY` filters through the service and renders:

```text
ID
Created
Project
Title
Proposed option
Proposed by
```

`neural decision show DECISION_UUID` renders the full Decision details, including alternatives,
Observation IDs, embedded evidence references, optional supersession, idempotency key, and tags.

### Decision acceptance commands

`neural decision accept DECISION_UUID` requires:

```text
DECISION_UUID
--accepted-by
--reason
--idempotency-key
```

It accepts repeatable optional values:

```text
--evidence
--tag
```

For example:

```bash
neural decision accept DECISION_UUID \
  --accepted-by architecture-owner \
  --reason "Approved after architecture review" \
  --idempotency-key decision-acceptance-1 \
  --evidence '{"kind":"manual_decision","locator":"approval:architecture-review"}' \
  --tag architecture
```

The CLI parses and validates `EvidenceReference`, but does not read the locator or ingest locator
content. Business rules remain in `DecisionAcceptanceService`. Success prints the stored
acceptance ID.

`neural decision acceptance-history DECISION_UUID` validates the Decision through the service and
renders:

```text
ID
Accepted
Decision ID
Accepted by
Reason
```

An existing Decision with no acceptance produces a controlled empty state.

### Decision action and state commands

`neural decision action add DECISION_UUID` requires:

```text
--acceptance-id
--action-type
--summary
--performed-by
--started-at
--idempotency-key
```

It accepts these optional values; evidence and tags are repeatable:

```text
--completed-at
--playbook-run-id
--evidence
--tag
```

The CLI parses timestamps as ISO-8601 values and parses evidence as embedded
`EvidenceReference` values. It does not execute commands or open evidence locators. Business rules
remain in `DecisionActionService`, and success prints the stored action ID.

`neural decision action-history DECISION_UUID` renders:

```text
ID
Recorded
Action type
Performed by
Started
Completed
Summary
```

An existing Decision with no actions produces a controlled empty state.
`neural decision action-show ACTION_UUID` renders every DecisionAction field.

`neural decision state DECISION_UUID` renders exactly one of:

```text
proposed
accepted
in_progress
```

It renders no later lifecycle state.

## Future lifecycle boundary

The accepted future record family remains deliberately separate:

```text
Decision
→ DecisionAcceptance
→ DecisionAction
→ DecisionOutcome
→ DecisionReview
```

- `Decision` is the implemented proposed choice.
- `DecisionAcceptance` is the implemented explicit authorization for possible future execution.
- `DecisionAction` is the implemented record of work performed under an accepted Decision.
- `DecisionOutcome` would record factual results and validation evidence.
- `DecisionReview` would assess outcomes and hold candidate lessons.

Only the first three records exist. Future records must remain immutable semantic records rather
than fields on a mutable Decision or a duplicate generic event stream. A proposed option is not an
acceptance, acceptance is not execution, an outcome is not an Experience, and candidate lessons
are not automatically Knowledge or a Playbook change.

The currently derivable projection is only:

```text
Decision without acceptance
→ proposed

Decision with one valid acceptance
→ accepted

Decision with one valid acceptance and at least one valid action
→ in_progress
```

There is no executed, completed, succeeded, failed, or reviewed state. The minimal lifecycle
projection is canonical, but there is no generic full lifecycle replay service.

## Relationship to the domain chain

The implemented Decision may reference existing Observations as context. The implemented path and
future learning bridge remain explicit:

```text
Observation
→ Decision
→ DecisionAcceptance
→ DecisionAction
→ future DecisionOutcome
→ future DecisionReview
→ explicitly created Experience
→ explicitly created Knowledge
```

DecisionAction may optionally reference an existing PlaybookRun, with existence-only validation
because PlaybookRun and Playbook expose no project key. `DecisionOutcome` remains distinct from
Experience, and Decision review must never mutate a Playbook. Any connection from an action to
PlaybookEvaluation, EvolutionProposal, or the revision lifecycle requires a separate reviewed use
case.

## Self-observation and Consigliere boundaries

The future dogfooding flow remains a design direction:

```text
prompt
→ agent execution
→ review finding
→ decision/correction
→ implementation
→ validation
→ commit
→ push
→ post-work lesson
```

Commit `1964356` does not capture or ingest those events. Automatic candidates and manual
confirmation remain future concepts; no automatic persistence, ingestion, or learning exists.

Consigliere also remains future-only. It may later advise. No Consigliere integration exists, and
no recommendation can directly mutate NeuralEngine or authorize a durable record.

## Current non-behavior

Commit `1964356` does not implement:

```text
DecisionOutcome
DecisionReview
execution engine
command/shell execution
rejection
withdrawal
reversal
reopening
cancellation
replacement
executed/completed/succeeded/failed/reviewed states
file ingestion
git ingestion
automatic Observation creation
automatic Experience creation
automatic Knowledge creation
automatic Playbook creation or mutation
automatic evolution
Consigliere integration
```

It also does not execute commands referenced by evidence, open locators, automatically accept
Decisions, materialize Playbook revisions, or infer outcomes from `completed_at`. Explicit user
requests are required to create Decision, DecisionAcceptance, or DecisionAction records.

## Recommended next milestone

The one recommended next controlled slice is:

```text
DecisionOutcome foundation
```

It must remain separate from `DecisionReview`.

## Handbook synchronization policy

Generated Handbook outputs are rebuilt from source documents and templates and are never edited
manually. Copying the generated skill back to NeuralEngine is outside this synchronization task.

# ADR-0008: Decision Learning boundary

Status: Accepted

## Decision

Development decision tracking uses implemented separate immutable `Decision`,
`DecisionAcceptance`, and `DecisionAction` records with embedded immutable `EvidenceReference`
values. `DecisionOutcome` and `DecisionReview` remain separate future-only records. Lifecycle state
is derived from semantic records, not stored as mutable status or duplicated in a generic event
stream.

Decision tracking complements the existing Observation-to-Playbook chain. Evidence uses bounded
embedded references, durable writes require explicit authority, and Consigliere remains a future
advisory layer rather than authoritative storage.

## Consequences

- Recommendation, acceptance, execution, factual outcome, review, and learning remain distinct.
- Corrections append records instead of rewriting history.
- Application services own cross-record validation, derived state, and initial load-and-filter
  idempotency checks; repository ports remain persistence-focused.
- No automatic ingestion, persistence, learning, Playbook evolution, or Consigliere integration is
  implied.
- Source commit `1964356` implements Decision proposal, acceptance, action recording, and their
  CLI plus the canonical `DecisionLifecycleService`.
- Only proposed, accepted, and in-progress states can currently be derived. Action completion time
  does not imply lifecycle completion, success, failure, outcome, or review.
- Acceptance is authorization for possible future execution; it is not execution or reversal and
  creates no later lifecycle or learning record.
- The one recommended next milestone is `DecisionOutcome foundation`, kept separate from
  DecisionReview.
