# NeuralEngine Agent Rules

This file is generated from NeuralEngine Handbook.

## Required workflow

# Development Workflow

## Before work

1. Read `AGENTS.md`.
2. Read `.agent-work/project-state.md` when present.
3. Run `./scripts/validate.sh`.
4. Inspect affected code and tests.
5. Define the smallest complete scope.
6. Create a task prompt under `.agent-work/prompts/`.

## During work

- Implement a coherent vertical slice.
- Follow current patterns.
- Add tests with implementation.
- Preserve public behavior unless explicitly changing it.
- Preserve persisted schemas unless explicitly changing them.
- Avoid unrelated cleanup.

## After work

1. Run `./scripts/validate.sh`.
2. Create a review file under `.agent-work/reviews/`.
3. Include validation output, diff stat, diff check, git status, and full diff.
4. Stop without committing or pushing.

## Architecture

# Architecture

NeuralEngine follows a hexagonal architecture.

## Layers

- Domain
- Application
- Ports
- Infrastructure
- CLI

## Dependency rules

- Domain depends on no outer layer.
- Application depends on domain and ports.
- Infrastructure implements ports.
- CLI invokes application services.
- Dependency construction belongs in the container.
- Infrastructure must never depend on CLI.

## Responsibility rules

- Entities and value objects own domain invariants.
- Application services own use cases.
- Repository ports define persistence contracts.
- Adapters implement persistence contracts.
- CLI translates input and renders output.
- Relationship navigation should be composed in services when it does not belong in persistence.

## Agent policy

# Agent Assignment Policy

## Codex GPT-5.5 medium

Use for:

- new features,
- domain models,
- vertical slices,
- ports and adapters,
- repositories and services,
- dependency injection,
- CLI additions,
- persisted schema changes,
- public behavior changes,
- validation-order changes,
- provenance decisions,
- architectural documentation.

## DeepSeek

Use only for small controlled post-review fixes, normally one to three files:

- one concrete bug,
- targeted regression tests,
- Ruff or MyPy corrections,
- small message, type, validation, or CLI-option fixes,
- minor refactors without behavior change.

Every DeepSeek prompt must begin with reading `AGENTS.md`.

Required scope guard:

> Do not add features. Do not broaden scope. Do not change architecture, persisted schemas, public behavior, validation order, or provenance rules. Modify only the files required for the specified fix.

## Definition of Done

# Definition of Done

A task is complete only when:

- requested behavior is implemented,
- scope has not expanded,
- architectural boundaries are preserved,
- tests cover the change,
- all required validation passes,
- prompt and review artifacts exist,
- review includes complete evidence,
- no commit or push was performed.
