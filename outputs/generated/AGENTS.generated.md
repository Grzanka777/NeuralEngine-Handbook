## Required workflow

# Development Workflow

## Before work

1. Read `AGENTS.md`.
2. Read `.agent-work/project-state.md` when present.
3. Run `./scripts/validate.sh`.
4. Inspect affected code and tests.
5. Define the smallest complete scope.
6. Create a task prompt under `.agent-work/prompts/`.

## During work

- Implement a coherent vertical slice.
- Follow current patterns.
- Add tests with implementation.
- Preserve public behavior unless explicitly changing it.
- Preserve persisted schemas unless explicitly changing them.
- Avoid unrelated cleanup.

## After work

1. Run `./scripts/validate.sh`.
2. Create a review file under `.agent-work/reviews/`.
3. Include validation output, diff stat, diff check, git status, and full diff.
4. Stop without committing or pushing.

## Future self-observation workflow

NeuralEngine development is intended to become a dogfooding source through:

```text
prompt
→ agent execution
→ review finding
→ decision/correction
→ implementation
→ validation
→ commit
→ push
→ post-work lesson
```

Automatic capture produces candidates only. Manual confirmation authorizes durable records;
immutable records preserve the audit trail; derived summaries remain replaceable views. No
automatic persistence, ingestion, or learning exists.

## Handbook synchronization

```text
major NeuralEngine milestone
→ commit/push NeuralEngine
→ sync NeuralEngine-Handbook
→ generate SKILL.md
→ copy generated SKILL.md back to NeuralEngine
→ commit/push skill sync
```

Each repository change is separate and reviewable. Generated outputs are rebuilt from Handbook
sources and are never edited manually.

## Architecture

# Architecture

NeuralEngine follows a hexagonal architecture.

## Layers

- Domain
- Application
- Ports
- Infrastructure
- CLI

## Dependency rules

- Domain depends on no outer layer.
- Application depends on domain and ports.
- Infrastructure implements ports.
- CLI invokes application services.
- Dependency construction belongs in the container.
- Infrastructure must never depend on CLI.

## Responsibility rules

- Entities and value objects own domain invariants.
- Application services own use cases.
- Repository ports define persistence contracts.
- Adapters implement persistence contracts.
- CLI translates input and renders output.
- Relationship navigation should be composed in services when it does not belong in persistence.

## Revision lifecycle and application boundary

The current end of the domain chain is deliberately split across three immutable records:

```text
PlaybookRevision
→ PlaybookRevisionActivation
→ PlaybookRevisionApplication
```

`PlaybookRevision` is a candidate snapshot. `PlaybookRevisionActivation` records lifecycle and
audit decisions. `PlaybookRevisionApplication` records application intent and audit state.
Activation does not imply application.

`PlaybookRevisionActivationService.get_active_revision_for_playbook(playbook_id)` is the canonical
owner of active-revision resolution. `PlaybookRevisionApplicationService` delegates to it and must
not duplicate activation-history replay.

The application foundation has a domain model, repository port, JSON adapter at
`NeuralPaths.PLAYBOOK_REVISION_APPLICATIONS`, and container wiring for both repository and service.
`PlaybookRevisionApplicationService.add(...)` validates that the Playbook, revision, and proposal
exist; the proposal is still accepted; the revision belongs to the supplied Playbook and proposal;
an optional source activation exists and matches the same relation; and the requested revision is
currently active.

Read-only application navigation verifies the source entity, calls
`PlaybookRevisionApplicationRepository.load_all()`, filters in the application layer, and preserves
repository order. No relation-specific repository query methods exist.

Activation inspection and lifecycle-write CLI commands exist. Application CLI commands do not.
Records created by the current application service have `content_changed=False`; there is no
Playbook content mutation, revision materialization, proposal mutation or application, proposal
status change, or automatic evolution.

This architecture snapshot corresponds to source commit `88921c5` (`feat: add playbook revision
application foundation`). Source validation for that milestone reported 537 passing tests; this is
a milestone snapshot, not a timeless guarantee.

## Decision Learning boundary

Source commit `9d5d47b` implements separate immutable `Decision` and `DecisionAcceptance` records,
embedded `EvidenceReference`, persistence-focused ports and JSON adapters, application services,
container wiring, and thin proposal/acceptance CLI commands. Acceptance explicitly authorizes
possible future execution; it does not execute or mutate the Decision.

`DecisionAction`, `DecisionOutcome`, and `DecisionReview` remain future-only. Only `proposed` and
`accepted` can currently be derived. There is no execution, reversal, ingestion, automatic
learning, full lifecycle replay, or Consigliere integration. The authoritative implemented
contract and future boundary are defined in
`handbook/architecture/decision-learning.md`.

## Agent policy

# Agent Assignment Policy

## Codex GPT-5.5 medium

Use for:

- new features,
- domain models,
- vertical slices,
- ports and adapters,
- repositories and services,
- dependency injection,
- CLI additions,
- persisted schema changes,
- public behavior changes,
- validation-order changes,
- provenance decisions,
- architectural documentation.

## DeepSeek

Use only for small controlled post-review fixes, normally one to three files:

- one concrete bug,
- targeted regression tests,
- Ruff or MyPy corrections,
- small message, type, validation, or CLI-option fixes,
- minor refactors without behavior change.

Every DeepSeek prompt must begin with reading `AGENTS.md`.

Required scope guard:

> Do not add features. Do not broaden scope. Do not change architecture, persisted schemas, public behavior, validation order, or provenance rules. Modify only the files required for the specified fix.

## Definition of Done

# Definition of Done

A task is complete only when:

- requested behavior is implemented,
- scope has not expanded,
- architectural boundaries are preserved,
- tests cover the change,
- all required validation passes,
- prompt and review artifacts exist,
- review includes complete evidence,
- no commit or push was performed.
