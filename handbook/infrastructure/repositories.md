# Repository Adapters

## Responsibility

Repository adapters implement repository ports.

## Implementation rules

- Preserve domain identity exactly.
- Preserve provenance fields.
- Make serialization round-trippable.
- Keep ordering deterministic when public behavior depends on ordering.
- Handle missing records according to the port contract.
- Do not broaden the port from inside the adapter.
- Do not add business filtering without an application requirement.

## Testing requirements

Repository adapters require tests for:

- save and load,
- missing identity,
- list behavior,
- ordering where relevant,
- serialization round trip,
- invalid/corrupted persisted data,
- provenance preservation.

## Revision application adapter

`JsonPlaybookRevisionApplicationRepository` implements
`PlaybookRevisionApplicationRepository` and stores application audit records under
`NeuralPaths.PLAYBOOK_REVISION_APPLICATIONS`. It supplies only the port's basic save, load-all, and
identity lookup operations; relation filtering remains in the application layer.

## Decision adapter

`JsonDecisionRepository` implements `DecisionRepository` and stores one JSON file per Decision
under `NeuralPaths.DECISIONS`. UUIDs, timestamps, optional values, and embedded
`EvidenceReference` values round-trip through domain validation. `load_all()` sorts file names for
deterministic order, and malformed data surfaces validation errors. The adapter performs no
project filtering, idempotency query, migration, or ingestion.

## Decision acceptance adapter

`JsonDecisionAcceptanceRepository` implements `DecisionAcceptanceRepository` and stores one JSON
file per acceptance under `NeuralPaths.DECISION_ACCEPTANCES`; Brain initialization creates the
directory. UUIDs, timestamps, embedded evidence, and tags round-trip through domain validation.
`load_all()` sorts file names for deterministic order, and malformed data surfaces validation
errors. The adapter performs no relation filtering, eligibility decision, migration, or ingestion.

## Decision action adapter

`JsonDecisionActionRepository` implements `DecisionActionRepository` and stores one JSON file per
action under `NeuralPaths.DECISION_ACTIONS`; Brain initialization creates the directory. Complete
DecisionAction records round-trip through domain validation. `load_all()` sorts file names for
deterministic order, and malformed data surfaces validation errors. The adapter performs no
relation filtering, lifecycle projection, migration, ingestion, or command execution.

## Decision outcome adapter

`JsonDecisionOutcomeRepository` implements `DecisionOutcomeRepository` and stores one JSON file
per outcome under `NeuralPaths.DECISION_OUTCOMES`; Brain initialization creates the directory.
Complete DecisionOutcome records, including immutable scalar metrics, round-trip through domain
validation. JSON object keys and metric keys are serialized deterministically, `load_all()` sorts
file names, and malformed data surfaces validation errors. The adapter performs no relation
validation or filtering, latest-outcome selection, summary or lifecycle projection, idempotency
decision, migration, ingestion, review, or learning.

## Decision review adapter

`JsonDecisionReviewRepository` implements `DecisionReviewRepository` and stores one JSON file per
review under `NeuralPaths.DECISION_REVIEWS`; Brain initialization creates the directory. Complete
DecisionReview records round-trip through domain validation. JSON object keys are serialized with
`indent=2` and `sort_keys=True`, `load_all()` sorts filenames, and malformed data surfaces
validation errors. The adapter performs no Decision filtering, relation validation, chronology,
idempotency selection, lifecycle projection, evidence ingestion, learning, or Consigliere work.
