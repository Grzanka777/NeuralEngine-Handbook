# Agent Assignment Policy

## Codex GPT-5.5 medium

Use for:

- new features,
- domain models,
- vertical slices,
- ports and adapters,
- repositories and services,
- dependency injection,
- CLI additions,
- persisted schema changes,
- public behavior changes,
- validation-order changes,
- provenance decisions,
- architectural documentation.

## DeepSeek

Use only for small controlled post-review fixes, normally one to three files:

- one concrete bug,
- targeted regression tests,
- Ruff or MyPy corrections,
- small message, type, validation, or CLI-option fixes,
- minor refactors without behavior change.

Every DeepSeek prompt must begin with reading `AGENTS.md`.

Required scope guard:

> Do not add features. Do not broaden scope. Do not change architecture, persisted schemas, public behavior, validation order, or provenance rules. Modify only the files required for the specified fix.
