# Dependency Injection and Container

## Responsibility

The container is the composition root.

It constructs concrete adapters and injects them into application services.

## Rules

The container may:

- instantiate repositories,
- instantiate infrastructure providers,
- instantiate application services,
- define lifecycle and sharing policy,
- expose configured services to CLI.

The container must not:

- contain business logic,
- perform use-case orchestration,
- parse CLI arguments,
- hide mutable global state,
- create cyclic dependencies.

## Constructor injection

Prefer constructor injection.

Good:

```python
service = PlaybookRevisionService(repository=revision_repository)
```

Avoid service locator access inside services:

```python
repository = container.get("revision_repository")
```

## Change policy

Any container or registration change is architectural work owned by Codex.
