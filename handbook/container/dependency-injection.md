# Dependency Injection and Container

## Responsibility

The container is the composition root.

It constructs concrete adapters and injects them into application services.

## Rules

The container may:

- instantiate repositories,
- instantiate infrastructure providers,
- instantiate application services,
- define lifecycle and sharing policy,
- expose configured services to CLI.

The container must not:

- contain business logic,
- perform use-case orchestration,
- parse CLI arguments,
- hide mutable global state,
- create cyclic dependencies.

## Constructor injection

Prefer constructor injection.

Good:

```python
service = PlaybookRevisionService(repository=revision_repository)
```

Avoid service locator access inside services:

```python
repository = container.get("revision_repository")
```

## Change policy

Any container or registration change is architectural work owned by Codex.

The current revision application foundation is wired through
`Container.playbook_revision_application_repository()` and
`Container.playbook_revision_application_service()`. The service receives its repositories and a
`PlaybookRevisionActivationService`, preserving canonical ownership of active-revision resolution.

The Decision foundation is wired through `Container.decision_repository()` and
`Container.decision_service()`. The container supplies `JsonDecisionRepository` and
`JsonObservationRepository` to `DecisionService`; Decision CLI handlers resolve the service and do
not construct repositories.

The acceptance foundation is wired through `Container.decision_acceptance_repository()` and
`Container.decision_acceptance_service()`. The container supplies
`JsonDecisionAcceptanceRepository` and `JsonDecisionRepository` to
`DecisionAcceptanceService`; acceptance CLI handlers construct no repositories.

The action foundation is wired through `Container.decision_action_repository()` and
`Container.decision_action_service()`. The action service receives JSON action, Decision,
acceptance, and PlaybookRun repositories.

The outcome foundation is wired through `Container.decision_outcome_repository()` and
`Container.decision_outcome_service()`. The outcome service receives JSON outcome, Decision,
acceptance, and action repositories. `Container.decision_lifecycle_service()` receives those same
four repository categories so it can validate relations and derive the canonical state. Decision
action, outcome, summary, and state CLI handlers resolve services and construct no repositories.

The review foundation is wired through `Container.decision_review_repository()` and
`Container.decision_review_service()`. The service receives `JsonDecisionReviewRepository`,
`JsonDecisionRepository`, `JsonDecisionAcceptanceRepository`, and
`JsonDecisionOutcomeRepository`. Brain initialization creates `NeuralPaths.DECISION_REVIEWS`.
Decision review CLI handlers resolve the service and construct no repositories.

`Container.experience_service()` supplies `JsonExperienceRepository`,
`JsonObservationRepository`, and the existing validated `DecisionReviewService` boundary to
`ExperienceService`. The container adds no promotion policy, link repository, path, or lifecycle
behavior; `neural experience from-review` resolves this service like the ordinary Experience
commands.

`Container.knowledge_service()` supplies `JsonKnowledgeRepository` and the constructed
`ExperienceService` as the narrow `ExperienceReader`. It does not inject a raw
`JsonExperienceRepository` into KnowledgeService. This keeps promoted-Experience validation in
one owner and preserves an acyclic graph:

```text
KnowledgeService
→ ExperienceReader
→ ExperienceService
→ ExperienceRepository + ObservationRepository + DecisionReviewService
```

ExperienceService has no KnowledgeService dependency, and the container adds no Knowledge
validation or learning policy.
