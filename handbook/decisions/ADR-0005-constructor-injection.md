# ADR-0005: Constructor injection

Status: Accepted

## Decision

Application services receive dependencies through constructors.

The dependency container remains the composition root.

## Consequences

- Dependencies are visible.
- Services are testable with fakes.
- Service-locator access inside application code is prohibited.
